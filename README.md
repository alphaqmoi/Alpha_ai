## Qmoi Model: HuggingFace Hub Integration

To use your Qmoi model for both trading and chat, upload it to the HuggingFace Hub and set the following environment variables:

- `HF_QMOI_API_URL`: The HuggingFace Inference API endpoint for your model (e.g. `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_QMOI_MODEL`)
- `HF_QMOI_TOKEN`: Your HuggingFace access token (with Inference API permissions)

### Uploading your Qmoi model to HuggingFace

1. [Create a HuggingFace account](https://huggingface.co/join)
2. [Create a new model repository](https://huggingface.co/new)
3. Push your model files (e.g. `pytorch_model.bin`, `config.json`, tokenizer, etc.) using the `transformers` CLI or `git lfs`:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli login
transformers-cli repo create YOUR_QMOI_MODEL
cd Qmoi
transformers-cli upload ./ --repo_id YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_QMOI_MODEL
```

Or use `git lfs`:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_QMOI_MODEL
cp -r Qmoi/* YOUR_QMOI_MODEL/
cd YOUR_QMOI_MODEL
git add .
git commit -m "Add Qmoi model files"
git push
```

4. Set your environment variables in `.env` or your deployment config:

```
HF_QMOI_API_URL=https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_QMOI_MODEL
HF_QMOI_TOKEN=hf_xxx...your_token...
```

5. Restart your server. The backend will now use your Qmoi model for chat and trading decisions.

If the HuggingFace API is not configured, the system will fallback to OpenAI for chat and to the local Python script for trading.
